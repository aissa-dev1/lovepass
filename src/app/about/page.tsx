            1. Go to the Create LovePass page and fill in the recipient&apos;s
            name, your name, and a personal love note.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Your privacy is important to us. Your LovePass data is currently
            stored in our database, allowing you to retrieve it when needed.
            However, at this stage, data is not linked to a personal account,
            meaning access is limited to the device and browser where it was
            created. In the future, we plan to introduce a way for users to
            retrieve their LovePass across different devices. We do not share
            your data with any third parties.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Fun Details</h3>
          <p>
            LovePass is designed to make sharing love and memories fun and easy.
            Enjoy creating and sharing your personalized LovePass cards!
